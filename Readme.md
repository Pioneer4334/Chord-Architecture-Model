Accroding to Wikipedia, "Chord is a protocol and algorithm for a peer-to-peer distributed hash table. A distributed hash table stores key-value pairs by assigning keys to different computers (known as "nodes"); a node will store the values for all the keys for which it is responsible. Chord specifies how keys are assigned to nodes, and how a node can discover the value for a given key by first locating the node responsible for that key." Chord architecture is an overlay network that forms a ring structure in top of real network. A data-item is the data that we are looking for and a node is the computer which is responsible for the data-item. By saying a node is responsbile for the data-item, we mean, the node stores the address of the data or the data itself. Chord Architecture is a structured peer-to-peer network that implements an efficient	and	deterministic scheme to uniquely map the key of the data-item to the identifier of a node such that a data-item with key "k"	is mapped to a	node with smallest id	> k.

This program is an attempt to simulate the chord architecture. It enables the user to add a node, delete a node or look-up a node responsible for a data-item. Indices are used to represent different types of nodes.

Constraints: The simulation does not make use of a distributed hash-table or finger table. So, it stil needs improvement in this aspect.
